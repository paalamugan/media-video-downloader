- Easy to customize
- Minimal code
- SEO-friendly
- 🚀 Production-ready

### Requirements

- Node.js 16+ and npm

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/paalamugan/next13-chakra-ui-boilerplate.git my-project-name
cd my-project-name
pnpm install
```

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see your project.

### Set up authentication

Create a Clerk account at [Clerk.com](https://clerk.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=nextjs-boilerplate) and create a new application in Clerk Dashboard. Then, copy `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` into `.env.local` file (not tracked by Git):

```shell
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_pub_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
```

Now, you can a fully working authentication system with Next.js: Sign up, Sign in, Sign out, Forgot password, Reset password, Update profile, Update password, Update email, Delete account, and more.

### Set up remote database

The project uses DrizzleORM, a type-safe ORM compatible with SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL databases. By default, the project is set up to work seamlessly with libSQL, and for production purposes, it's integrated with [Turso](https://turso.tech/?utm_source=nextjsstarterbp). The Next.js Boilerplate also enables a smooth transition to an alternative database provider if your project requires it.

First, you need to create a Turso account at [Turso.tech](https://turso.tech/?utm_source=nextjsstarterbp) and install the Turso CLI:

```shell
brew install tursodatabase/tap/turso
turso auth signup # Sign up to Turso
```

Then, create a new database:

```shell
turso db create nextjs-boilerplate
```

Now, you need to update the `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` file with the database URL provided by Turso:

```shell
turso db show nextjs-boilerplate --url

# .env
# DATABASE_URL=libsql://[RANDOM-CHARS]-[DB-NAME]-[ORG-NAME].turso.io
```

Finally, you also need to create a new environement variable `DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN` in `.env.local` (not tracked by Git) with the auth token provided by Turso:

```shell
turso db tokens create nextjs-boilerplate

# .env.local
# DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN=[your-auth-token]
```

### Customization

You can easily configure Next js Boilerplate by making a search in the whole project with `FIXME:` for making quick customization. Here is some of the most important files to customize:

- `public/apple-touch-icon.png`, `public/favicon.ico`, `public/favicon-16x16.png` and `public/favicon-32x32.png`: your website favicon, you can generate from https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
- `src/styles/global.css`: your global CSS file
- `src/utils/AppConfig.ts`: configuration file
- `src/templates/Main.tsx`: default theme
- `next-sitemap.config.js`: sitemap configuration

You have access to the whole code source if you need further customization. The provided code is only example for you to start your project. The sky is the limit 🚀.

### Commit Message Format

The project enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This means that all your commit messages must be formatted according to the specification. To help you write commit messages, the project uses [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), an interactive CLI that guides you through the commit process. To use it, run the following command:

```shell
pnpm commit
```

One of the benefits of using Conventional Commits is that it allows us to automatically generate a `CHANGELOG` file. It also allows us to automatically determine the next version number based on the types of commits that are included in a release.

### Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```shell
$ pnpm build
$ pnpm start
```

You can create an optimized production build with:

```shell
pnpm build
```

Now, your blog is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at `out` folder, which you can deploy with any hosting service.

### Testing

All tests are colocated with the source code inside the same directory. So, it makes it easier to find them. Unfortunately, it is not possible with the `pages` folder which is used by Next.js for routing. So, what is why we have a `pages.test` folder to write tests from files located in `pages` folder.

### Deploy to Netlify

Clone this repository on own GitHub account and deploy to Netlify:

### Deploy to Vercel

Deploy this Next JS Boilerplate on Vercel in one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fixartz%2FNext-js-Boilerplate)

### VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode users, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

With the plugins installed on your VSCode, ESLint and Prettier can automatically fix the code and show you the errors. Same goes for testing, you can install VSCode Jest extension to automatically run your tests and it also show the code coverage in context.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with `<kbd>`Cmd `</kbd>` + `<kbd>`Shift `</kbd>` + `<kbd>`B `</kbd>` on Mac.
